# Maven Hospital Challenge

## Project Overview

The Maven Hospital Challenge project is designed to create a high-level Key Performance Indicator (KPI) report for a hospital's executive team. This report offers critical insights into the hospital's performance by analyzing a subset of patient records, focusing on key metrics that reflect both operational efficiency and financial health.

## Key Objectives

The primary objectives of this project include:

1. **Admission and Readmission Tracking:**
   - Monitor the number of patient admissions and readmissions over time to assess patient flow and hospital utilization trends.
   
2. **Average Length of Stay:**
   - Calculate and analyze the average duration of hospital stays to evaluate operational efficiency and patient care management.
   
3. **Average Cost per Visit:**
   - Determine the average cost incurred per patient visit to assess financial performance and identify opportunities for cost optimization.
   
4. **Insurance Coverage of Procedures:**
   - Track the percentage of procedures covered by insurance to gauge the effectiveness of revenue streams and reimbursement processes.

## Project Significance

The insights generated from this KPI report will enable the hospital's executive team to make data-driven decisions aimed at improving patient care, optimizing resource allocation, and enhancing the hospital's financial stability. By focusing on key performance indicators, the project contributes to a deeper understanding of hospital operations and helps in strategic planning and decision-making.
